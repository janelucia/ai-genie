# AIGenie

## Description
This is AIGenie, a host for the AI Lab of OsloMet University. 
It is a web application that allows users to explore the AI Lab online and get help understanding the various AI topics using an AI Model.
The application features a chat interface with an AI assistant, information about researchers, research projects, and upcoming events.

## Important
Currently the application is only developed for mobile devices, therefore the viewport has to be set to a mobile device width in order to see the application correctly.
In future a desktop version should be developed to make it fully responsive.

## Getting started
